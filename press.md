Services Australia has signed a contract with Optus to deliver customer contact management services.

Services Australia has the largest contact centre operation in the southern hemisphere and handles over 1 billion online transactions and 55 million calls annually. It’s vital we have efficient and effective tools and capabilities in place to support our customers.

This procurement is an opportunity to modernise our telephony systems to serve Australians efficiently and effectively into the future.

We selected Optus’ solution and service offer as representing best value for money after a competitive tender process and comprehensive evaluation, which included rigorous consideration of security arrangements.

Optus has a proven track-record of delivering services for Australian Government departments and agencies, including the Department of Home Affairs, Australian Taxation Office, Department of Defence and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.
 
Optus’ modern, cloud-based contact centre solution – which they use for their own contact centres – provides us with known capability, and the flexibility and scalability we need to support whole-of-government policy objectives, and to modernise our services into the future.
 
Optus is an Australian leader in integrated communications, supported by a network that spans throughout Australia.   
Contract details are available on AusTender.

The agency has established separate contracts for future telecommunications services, under the Telecommunications Services Program, to ensure services are modern, fit-for-purpose and value for money. In addition to the agency’s new contract for customer contact management services, these include:

Corporate Telephony & Mobile and Satellite – through competitive procurement processes, the agency contracted Telstra to deliver future corporate telephony services and mobile telephony and satellite services for all agency staff and shared service partners, through two separate contracts (CN4030036 & CN4030009).
 
Networks and Data Carriage – the agency issued an approach to market for a Network Transformation Partner in January 2024 (RFT1000909785) and Network Telecommunication Services in March 2024 (RFQTM-01267). Responses to both approaches to market are currently being evaluated. 
Our contract with Telstra has underpinned our core service delivery and corporate telecommunications for more than a decade. We look forward to continuing to work with Telstra as our staff-facing telephony partner.

We have begun early engagement with Optus to ensure a smooth transition of our customer contact services. Telstra will continue to provide telecommunications services until 2025, to ensure continuity of critical services for our customers while we transition.
